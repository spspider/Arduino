/*
 * This example serves a "hello world" on a WLAN and a SoftAP at the same time.
 * The SoftAP allow you to configure WLAN parameters at run time. They are not setup in the sketch but saved on EEPROM.
 * 
 * Connect your computer or cell phone to wifi network ESP_ap with password 12345678. A popup may appear and it allow you to go to WLAN config. If it does not then navigate to http://192.168.4.1/wifi and config it there.
 * Then wait for the module to connect to your wifi and take note of the WLAN IP it got. Then you can disconnect from ESP_ap and return to your regular WLAN.
 * 
 * Now the ESP8266 is in your network. You can reach it through http://192.168.x.x/ (the IP you took note of) or maybe at http://esp8266.local too.
 * 
 * This is a captive portal because through the softAP it will redirect any http request to http://192.168.4.1/
 */

/* Set these to your desired softAP credentials. They are not configurable at runtime */
